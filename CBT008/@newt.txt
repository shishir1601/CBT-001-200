 
 Jobs used to create the CBT Tape are named NEWTvvvn, where vvv is the
 tape version.  Each job writes a maximum of 100 files on the tape,
 because of the limit on TIOT size, limiting the number of DD entries
 that can be coded in one job.  Sometimes the last job will contain
 a few more than 100 jobs, but when it gets too big, a new job will
 be created after the last "100 file boundary".
 
 Load modules needed for File 008 can be found in the LOADLIB member
 here, or on CBT Tape File 035.
 
 It is assumed that volumes, V488MT (SL)
                             C488MU (SL)
                             CBT488 (NL)  are properly initted tapes.
 
 The tape created is assumed (at present) to be a 3490E or a 3590.
 I'm not really sure about a 3490E.  If anyone still needs a real
 tape, please let me know.  We also have a 3390-2 disk which has
 all the CBT files.  There is a DFDSS backup of it (tersed) and
 an FDR backup of it (tersed) on the www.cbttape.org web site.
