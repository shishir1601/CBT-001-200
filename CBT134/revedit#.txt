*                    TSO HELP FOR 'REVEDIT' RELEASE 41.5     MARCH 2008
)F Function -
  REVEDIT is the fullscreen editor component of the REVIEW command.
  REVEDIT is not a TSO command, but this HELP member will be accessed
  when HELP is requested in a non-ISPF environment.
 
  REVEDIT allows the editing of MVS data sets residing on direct
  access storage devices (DASD) which may contain records which have
  a fixed-length or variable-length format.  Currently only non-VSAM
  is supported.
 
  Under MVS/ESA and later (including OS/390 and z/OS) data being
  edited may be held in a data space which can grow with the data up
  to two gigabytes (2GB) in size subject to installation limits
  implemented either by design (eg. system exits) or circumstance (eg.
  insufficient auxiliary storage to allow processing to continue).
 
  On pre-ESA systems data being edited is held in the user's region.
 
  REVEDIT can also be invoked in VIEW mode indicated by blue (instead
  of green) line numbers.  Changes made to the data in VIEW mode
  cannot be saved back to the data set being viewed.  Data being
  viewed - whether changed or not - can be exported using the CREATE
  and/or REPLACE subcommands.
 
  When a data set is being edited it is serialized to protect against
  concurrent update.  This serialization is not performed for VIEW.
 
  REVIEW has an alias of REVED which changes the default action
  from Browse to Edit.
)X Syntax -
         UPDATE
     or, if not in an ISPF environment
         EDIT
     or, for VIEW mode when not in a ISPF environment
         VIEW
)O Operands -
   Member name if invoking from a member list.

       for a string of hexadecimal digits byte-aligned with two
       digits per data byte.
   4.  Quotation marks are required whenever the string type needs
       to be specified.
   5.  Quotation marks are optional for the default string type
       unless the string contains one or more blank characters.

  display.  Alternatively, EXCLUDE may be used to exclude all lines.
 
  EXCLUDE notes:
   1.  A search argument is required unless ALL is the only
       operand specified.  A single unquoted asterisk may
       be used to specify the same argument as was last used.
   2.  The first operand is always treated as the search argument
       unless ALL is the only operand specified.
   3.  The search argument determines whether the search is case
       sensitive, case insensitive or for a picture string, or
       for a string of hexadecimal digits byte-aligned with two
       digits per data byte.
   4.  Quotation marks are required whenever the string type needs
       to be specified.
   5.  Quotation marks are optional for the default string type

       data replacement specification or "to string".  For either
       operand (or both operands) a single unquoted asterisk may be
       used to specify the same argument as was last used
   2.  The first operand is always treated as the search argument.
   3.  The search argument determines whether the search is case
       sensitive, case insensitive or for a picture string, or
       for a string of hexadecimal digits byte-aligned with two
       digits per data byte.
   4.  If the replacement specification is a picture string then
       it must be the same length as the search argument.
   5.  The only picture string mask characters that are recognised
       in the "to string" are '=' (to leave the character unchanged),
       '>' (to perform upper case translation), and '<' (to perform
       lower case translation).  All other characters are processed
       literally.
   6.  Quotation marks are required whenever the string type needs
       to be specified.
   7.  Quotation marks are optional for the default string type
       unless the string contains one or more blank characters.
   8.  Operands specifying various keywords and/or column numbers
       may be supplied in any order after the search argument.

              Unquoted strings and strings without a string type
              specified are treated as text (type T) strings,
              which requests a case insensitive search.

            specified condition.
=SORT
)F   The SORT subcommand allows records to be reordered according to
  data content.
)X Syntax -
       SORT 'column-1'  'column-2'
               A / D
               EX / NX
 
 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - A (ascending order), and all records are sorted.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'column-1' - Optional, specifies first column of the sort field.
                If not specified the start of the record is assumed.
)P 'column-2' - Optional, specifies last column of the sort field.
                If not specified the end of the record is assumed,
                except for sequence numbers which are not sorted
                unless the sort field starts within the sequence
                number data.
))A           - Requests sorting in ascending order.
                This is the default.
))D           - Requests sorting in descending order.
))EX          - Only search records excluded from display.  X for short.
))NX          - Only search records not excluded from display.
))COMMAND - specifies that a pending line command rather than a
=HILITE=HI
)F   The HILITE subcommand controls syntax coloring and highlighting.
  This status is saved in the profile if one exists.  The highlighting
  is only ever displayed when 80-byte records are being edited.
)X Syntax -
     HILITE AUTO / ASM / JCL / OFF
 
 Alias    - HI
 Default  - None.
 Required - one of AUTO, ASM, JCL or OFF.
)O Operands -
))AUTO    - specifies that both JCL and non-JCL source highlighting
            may be displayed.  JCL syntax highlighting is used for
            records beginning with '//' or '/*'.  Other source types
            may be detected based upon the data content, especially
            the first non-comment record.
))JCL     - specifies JCL syntax highlighting is to be displayed
            whenever records beginning with '//' or '/*' are shown.
            Non-JCL records will not be highlighted.
))ASM     - specifies that automatic syntax highlighting is to be
            enabled, and that Assembler source syntax highlighting
            is to be used for non-JCL records in this session.
))CLIST   - specifies that automatic syntax highlighting is to be
            enabled, and that TSO CLIST source syntax highlighting
            is to be used for non-JCL records in this session.
))PLI     - specifies that automatic syntax highlighting is to be
            enabled, and that PL/I source syntax highlighting is
            to be used for non-JCL records in this session.
))DATA    - specifies that automatic syntax highlighting is to be
            enabled, but that no highlighting is to be used for
            non-JCL records in this session.
))OFF     - specifies syntax highlighting is never to be displayed.
            This also suppresses JCL highlighting extensions such
            as data set name catalog look-up.
=UNDO
)F   The UNDO subcommand without operands instructs the editor to
  restore the data to the state that existed before the latest
  changes input by the user were applied.  Only changes performed
  in the current Edit session since UNDO was last activated can be
  undone.  No more than 31 consecutive UNDOs can ever be performed,
  and this number may not be achievable for large data sets.
 
  The UNDO subcommand with an operand controls whether UNDO is
  enabled or disabled.  UNDO will not be enabled if the data width
  exceeds an internal limit of around four thousand columns, nor
  if there are more records than an arbitrary internal limit.
 
  Use REDO to undo an UNDO.
)X Syntax -
     UNDO  ON / OFF
 
 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - Perform an UNDO operation.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON     - Specifies that necessary resources are to be acquired
         and that UNDO is to be enabled.
))OFF    - Specifies that UNDO is to be disabled and its associated
         resources can be released.
=REDO
)F   The REDO subcommand instructs the editor to reapply the changes
  which were removed by the most recent UNDO subcommand (that has
  not also been redone).
 
  REDO is only available if UNDO is enabled and has not not been
  disabled since the UNDO subcommand being backed out.  Once manual
  changes are applied to the edit data after an UNDO, that UNDO can
  no longer be backed out by REDO.
 
  Use UNDO to undo changes to the data before using REDO.
)X Syntax -
     REDO
 
 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=CANCEL=CAN
)F   The CANCEL subcommand instructs REVEDIT to discard all data
  being edited and terminate.
)X Syntax -
     CANCEL
 
 Alias    - CAN
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=END
)F   The END subcommand instructs REVEDIT to terminate after saving
  any changed data.  If the data cannot be saved then REVEDIT will
  not terminate.
)X Syntax -
     END
 
 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=EXIT=RETURN==X
)F   The EXIT subcommand performs the same processing as END, except
  that if REVEDIT was invoked from a member selection list then the
  member selection list will not be displayed but instead the entire
  REVIEW session will end.
)X Syntax -
     EXIT
 
 Aliases  - RETURN, =X
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
