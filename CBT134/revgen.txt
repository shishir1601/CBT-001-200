           FIND notes:
              1.  A search argument is required.  A single unquoted asterisk
                  may be used to specify the same argument as was last used.
              2.  The first operand is always treated as the search argument.
              3.  The sea  rch argument determines whether the search is case
                    sensitive, case insensitive or for a picture string, or
                    for a string of hexdecimal digits byte-aligned with two
                    digits per data byte  .
                  4.  Quotation marks are required whenever the string type need
s                     to be specified.
                  5.  Quotation marks are optional for   the default string type
                        unless the string contains one or more blank characters.
                    6.  Operands specifying various keywords and/or column numbe
rs                      may be supplied in any order after the search   argument
.                     7.  Searches for picture strings are not allowed in ASCII
mode.                 8.  If currently in ASCII mode a text or character string
specifed                  in the command will be translated to ASCII.
                        9.  The 'REST' and 'ALL' operands causes lines failing t
he match                    criteria to be excluded from view.  No place marker
lines for                   this exclusion are shown.  This exclusion is cancell

EDIT is the fullscreen editor component of the REVIEW command.                 R
EVEDIT is not a TSO command, but this HELP member will be accessed             w
hen HELP is requested in a non-ISPF environment.
                                                                               R
EVEDIT allo  ws the editing of MVS data sets residing on direct
 access storage devices (DASD) which may contain records which have
 a fixed-length or variable-length format.  Currently only non-VSAM
 is supported.
 
   Under MVS/ESA and later (including OS/390 and z/OS) data being
   edited may be held in a data space whi  ch can grow with the data up
     to two gigabytes (2GB) in size subject to installation limits
     implemented either by design (eg. system exits) or circumstance (eg.
     insufficient auxiliary storage to allow processing   to continue).
 
       On pre-ESA systems data being edited is held in the user region.
 
         REVEDIT can also be invoked in VIEW mode indicated by blue (instead
         of green) line numbers.  Changes made to the data in VIEW mode
         cannot be saved back to the data set being viewed.  Data being
           viewed - whether changed or not - can be exported using the CREATE
           and/or REPLACE subcommands.
 
           When a dat  a set is being edited it is serialized to protect against
             concurrent update.  This serialization is not performed for VIEW.
 
             REVIEW has an alias of   REVED which changes the default action
               from Browse to Edit.

rch argument.                 3.  The search argument determines whether the sea
rch is case                       sensitive, case insensitive or for a picture
 string, or                         for a string of hexadecimal digits byte-alig

 "from string" is required, as is a                         data replacement spe
cification or "to   string".  For either                      operand (or both o
perands) a single unquoted asterisk may be                    used to specify th
e same argument as was last used                          2.  The first operand
is always treated as the search a  rgument.                 3.  The search argum
ent determines whether the search is case                       sensitive, case
insensitive or for a picture string, or                         for a string of
hexadecimal digits byte-aligned with two                          digits per dat
a byte.                                                       4.  If the replace
ment specification is a picture string then                       it must be the
 same length as the search argument.                          5  .  The only pic
ture string mask characters that are recognised                     in the "to s
tring" are '=' (to leave the character unchanged),                  '>' (to perf
orm upper case translation), and '<' (to perform                    lower case
 translation).  All other characters are processed                    literally.

F Function -
 REVLEV is a processing option of RFE (REVIEW Front End) with the
   main function of presenting a list of data sets which then allows
   the easy selection of data sets for processing by utility functions.
 
   The initial   panel allows the specification of the data set name
     prefix and a volume serial number.
 
     If the volume serial numb  er field is left blank then the catalog
       is used as the source of data set names to list.
 
       If a volume serial number is supplied   the data sets on that volume
         are listed, subject to filtering by the specified data set name
         prefix.  If no data set name prefix is specified then all data sets
         on the volume are listed.
 
           When a data set name list is presented, each detail line has a
           single character selection code input field, the name of the dat  a
             set, and several attributes of the data set.
 
             Initially the list is sorted by data set name.  Any of the display
               columns can be used to sort the list, either in ascending or
               descending order.  Each sortable attribute has a default sort
               order.  For example, SORT NAME has a default sort order of
               ascending,   as does SORT VOLUME, but SORT AL and SORT US have a
                 default sort order of descending.
 
                 The input selection cod  e field can be used to trigger an acti
on                 upon the data set listed on that display line.

                     ======================
 
                       When a volume serial number is supplied, the resultant li
st of                  data sets is read from the Volume Table Of Contents (VTOC
) of                   that volume.  RFE also issues a Sense-Id I/O operation to
 the +                   volume and the type of device and control unit returned
 by   that                 operation are shown at the top left corner of the scr
een.
                           For terminals with suitable graphics facilities, and
when the                     geometry of the disk volume suits, a disk space usa
ge plot will                 be displayed after the end of the data set list.  E
ach track is                 represented by a single 3270 pixel.  The top row of
 pixels                      repr  esents track or head 0 of each cylinder, the
second pixel                   row represents track or head 1 of each cylinder,
and so on.                     The left-most column of pixels in the plot repres
ents cylinder 0.

more than one extent and any                               such space indicates
a corrupt VTOC.  Also, if a                                data set name prefix
was spec  ified, then all extents                            of all listed data

 )F   The CANCEL subcommand performs the same processing as the END
   subcommand without saving the REVIEW/FSHELP user profile to disk.
   The REVIEW/FSHELP user profile (which contains data display c  olors,
     scrolling amount and 24 PF Key values) is normally only rewritten to
     disk at the END of a REVIEW session if it has been changed during
     that session.  If a member list has not been displayed in a session
       then the REVIEW session is terminated without saving the user
       profile.  If a member list has been shown it is reshown but the user
       profile is no longer considered to have been altered, even though the
       profile   "in-core" still has the changes applied to it.  Changing the
         profile at this stage and exiting will cause all accumulated profile
         changes for the REVIEW session to be saved to disk unless another
         CANCEL is issued.

                                     The REVOUT command gives access to REVIEW's
 job status display.                   REVOUT uses the TSO FIB commands to displ
ay the status of jobs                  and display the contents of held SYSOUT.
 
                                       Jobs are lis  ted in the order returned b
y the STATUS TSO command.                The user can process listed jobs by ent
ering selection codes.                   REVOUT will use the OUTPUT and CANCEL T
SO commands to carry out                 the requested action(s).
 
                                           REVOUT requires that the REVOUTJB CLI
ST is installed for implicit               command execution.

      -------------------- MEMBER LIST SELECTION CODES --------------------
 
      These selection codes can be used to select a member entry for
      processi  ng from a directory member list display:
 
          S       - Selection code for selecting a member to be REVIEWed.
 
                      'S' is the default selection code, and is assumed
                                    when the cursor is placed on an entry select
ion input                           field containing a period but no character i
s typed.
                                      With the 'REVED' TSO command selecting a P
DS member                             with 'S' specifies that the member should
be edited                             with REVEDIT.
 
                              E       - Selection code for selecting a member to
 be edited.                             In an ISPF environment ISPF Edit is used
;                                       otherwise REVE  DIT is used.
 
                                B       - Selection code for selecting a member
to be browsed.                            In an ISPF environment ISPF   Browse i
s used;                                     otherwise REVIEW is used.
 
                                  V       - Selection code for selecting a membe
r to   be viewed.                             In an ISPF environment ISPF View i
s used;                                       otherwise REVEDIT is used in VIEW
mode.
                                      U       - Selection code for selecting a m
ember to be edited.                             REVEDIT is used.  REVEDIT will n
ot process members                              with an undefined record format,
 or members allowed                               to have spanned records.
 
                                        D       - Selection code for deleting a
member from an                                      unconcatenated PDS (not a PD
SE) such that it can be                             restored by the 'R' selectio
n code.
                                          N       - Selection co  de for renamin
g a member from an                                    unconcatenated PDS or data
 PDSE.  You will be                                   prompted for the new name.
 
                                              T       - Selection code for taggi
ng an entry for later processing.                       Tagged entries are shown
 in high intensity in the entry                         list.  If any members ar
e tagged, then   only tagged                              members are processed
during offload (see OFFLOAD and                           SEQLOAD), delink (see
DELINK) and search (see SEARCH)                           operations.  Further,
tagging an entry may be usefu+ l for                        display control purp
oses when the entry list is   large as                        RFIND can be used
to locate the next tagged entry.  All                         tags can be cleare
d by REFRESH and RESET.
                                                      R       - Selection code f
or restoring a deleted member and for                           resetting the ta
g status of an entry.  All tags can be                          cleared by REFRE
SH and RESET.  REFRESH will also clear                            display entrie
s for deleted members meaning that they                           cannot be rest
ored by the R selection code.
                                                        H       - Select  ion co
de for displaying the history of a program.                         The Binder d
ialog API is used to extract identification                         record (IDR)
 data which contains compile, link edit and                         zap timestam

370, the HISTORY subcommand of the PDS command                        is used to
 produce the displayed   output.
                                                              M       - Selectio
n code for displaying the module map of a program.                      The Bind
er dialog API is used to extract ESD   class data                         for lo
ad modules and compatible program objects, or MAP                         class
data from non-migratable program objects.
                                                                            Unde
r MVS/370, the MAP subcommand of the PDS command                            is u
sed to produce the displayed output.
                                                                  /         - Se
lection code for selecting a member to be REVIEWed                            as
 if the 'DATA' operand had been specified.  Normally,                         th
e DATA operand precludes access to PDS and PDSE member                        co
nt  ents.  This selection code performs the same function
as the 'S' selection code except that the DATA operand is
deemed to have been specified.  This will prevent REVIEW
from attempting t  o interpret data content such as
  pictures and ZIP directories.

                S       - Selection code for selecting a member to be REVIEWed.
                          'S' is the default selection code, and is assumed
                          when the cursor is place  d on an entry selection inpu
t                           field but no character is typed.

agged,                            then only tagged members are examined during a
 search.                            Further, tagging an entry may be useful for
display                             control purposes when the entry list is larg
e as RFIND                          can be used to locate the next tagged entry.
  All tags                          can be cl  eared by REFRESH and RESET.

Selection code for selecting a member to be REVIEWed

  the DATA operand precludes access to PDS and PDSE member
  contents.  This selection code performs the same function
  as the   'S' selection code except that the DATA operand is
    deemed to have been specified.  This will prevent REVIEW
    from attempting to interpret data content such as

 to be initiated and given control.  The new session will be under
 the RFE (REVIEW Front End) menu hierarchy.  The new session will
 NOT   be started if it would cause the maximum logical session
   limit to be exceeded.  If no operand is supplied the RFE primary
   option menu is shown.

ocumentation for the TSO command processing option                   of RFE (REV
IEW Front End).  REVTSO is not a TSO command.
                                                                     The process
ing panel presented by this option offers a number of                advantages
o  ver the TSO global subcommand, the main ones being:
                                                                       (1) An ex
tended input area is presented allowing command input                      up to
 234 characters   in length.                                             (2) The
 ten most recently issued commands are saved, and can be                     rec
alled by cursor selection.  That is, when the command input                  are
a is empty and the cursor is pl  aced on a screen line which                   d
isplays a previously issued command, that entire command is                    r
ecalled and placed in the main input area for optional editing                 b
efore being executed again.                                                  (3)
 Unlike the dynamic command recall stack which commences with
 the initial TSO command which sets up the REVIEW environment,
 the ten most recent commands can be saved in permanent stora  ge
   residing in the profile data set.
                                                                               I
n general, the above listed advantages not withstanding, this
 TSO command processing option has restrictions similar to those
 imposed on the global TSO subcommand.  In particular, this RFE
 option does not provide any special ability to initiate APF
 authorized   TSO processing.
 
   As with the global TSO subcommand, CLIST commands can be implicitly
   invoked.
 
     Should the user wish to not save the updated recent commands list
     the option can be exited using the C  ANCEL command.  Note that if
       any CANCEL operands are present the input is treated as a request
       to issue the TSO CANCEL (FIB) command.  The abbreviation CAN is not
       subject to this operand test.
 
         As with ISPF option 6, individual commands can be prevented from
         being recorded in the displayed list of recent commands simply+
           by prefixing the command string with 'TSO '.  This has the   effect
             of causing the command to be issued via the global TSO command
             facility instead of via the logic of the TSO command option.
 
               Exiting the TSO command processing option with the END command,
               or any inter-option jump string commencing with the equals sign
               '=' causes the current recent command list to be passed back to
               RFE.    Note that the command list will only be saved to the prof
ile              data set at the termination of the logical session (or split sc
reen).
                 The profile data   set is a single PDS allocated to the ISPPROF
 file              under z/OS, or the REVPROF file under MVS/370.  From a data
                   management point of view, the profile data set contains fixed
-length            80-byte records.  The saved co  mmands for this option are st

codes can be used to select an entry for                        processing from
a directory entry list display:
                                                                  S       - Sele
ction c  ode for selecting a file to be REVIEWed                              or
 a new directory to have its entries displayed.                               'S
' is the default selection code, and is assumed                               wh
en the cursor is place  d on an entry selection input
field but no character is typed.
                                                                      A       -
Selection code for selecting a file t  o be REVIEWed
  or a new directory to have its entries displayed.
  If a file is to be REVIEWed it will be treated as
  an ASCII text file, and not as a file containing
    EBCDIC data.  If a directory is selected the 'A'
    selection code will function as an 'S' selection code.
                                                                            E

      ISPF/PDF Edit is used.  This will only work if the
      file is acceptable to ISPF/PDF Edit and only in an
        ISPF environment.  This will not work if the 'REVIEW'
        command is issued from 'READY' mode.
                                                                              B
      - Selection   code for selecting a file to be browsed.
          ISPF/PDF Browse is used.  This will only work if the
                        file is acceptable to ISPF/PDF Browse and only in an
                        ISPF environment.  This will not work if the 'REVIEW'
                        command is issued from 'READY' mode.

es                          are processed during search (see SEARCH) operations.
                            Further, tagging an entry may be useful for display
                            control purpos  es when the entry list is large as R
FIND                          can be used to locate the next tagged entry.  All
tags                          can be cleared by REFRESH and RESET.
 
                      R       - Selection code for resetting the tag status of a
n entry.                        All tags can be cleared by REFRESH and RESET.

he history                        of a program.
 
                                    The Binder API is invoked to access IDR data
 which is                           then formatted and shown with one item per l
ine.  The                           last display record will usually contain the
 program                              bind (link edit) IDR data, including the d
ate and time                          of the bind.

                                        The Binder A  PI is invoked to access ES
D (for compatible                         program objects) or MAP (for other lev
els) data which                           is then formatted and shown with one i
tem per line.

                                                 The RFE command provides a 3270
 fullscreen environment for general                processing under TSO with an
emphasis on data set operations.  The              chief utility for examining a
nd changing data sets is the REVIEW                command, and for this reason
it is called the "REVIEW Front End".
                                                     RFE presents a primary opti
on menu from which an option is selected             by typing the option name i
nto the primary input area.  The 'END'               command returns control f
rom the selected option to the primary                 option menu.

irectly witho  ut an intervening display                 of the main menu is als
o possible by prefixing the target option                name with the equals si
gn.  For example, to jump to option 6                    enter the string '=6' (
without the quotes) in the p  rimary input                 area near the top of
the screen.

 logical sessions can exist.  A new session                  is created by the '
SPILT' command which is equivalent to entering               'TSO RFE' in the pr
imary input area.

sion is terminated by entering 'END' at the main               menu, or selectin
g the primary option of 'X'.  Consequently, an                 RFE logical sessi
on can be ended by the primary input sring of                  '=X' from   any R
FE option.

                                   (2) A bar graph of the frame count versus UIC
 distribution.
                                       The X-axis covers the allowable Unreferen
ced Interval Count                       (UIC) range from 0 to 255 with each 327
0 pixel covering 2                       adjacent UIC values.  The Y-axis plots
the number of frames                     with a given UIC value at a scale of 2
frames per 3270 pixel.                   Ver  tical bar plots are truncated at a
 frame count of 256                        which corresponds to 1MB of real stor
age.
                                           If a page frame   has not been refere
nced for 10 SRM intervals,                   it is said to have a UIC of 10.  An
 SRM interval may be                                       something like a coup
le of seconds elapsed time, depending                      on the CPU speed adju
stment factor, which is obviously                          model-dependent.

                    address space, these pages will be available for
                    reuse by the time you are reading this, because
                      the system will swap out your TSO session while
                      it waits for the next input from your TSO
                      terminal.  (While MVS 3.8J does not perform
                        logical swapping, it does exploit page reclaim.)
 
 
     Profile data set
       ================
 
       It is possible to save various   settings across RFE and TSO sessions.
         For this to occur the settings must be saved in permanent storage.
         This is achieved by writing those settings to a permanent data set
         at the end of an RFE session.
 
           The profile data set is a single PDS allocated to the ISPPROF file
           under z/OS, or the REVPROF file under MVS/370.  From a d  ata
             management point of view, the profile data set contains fixed-lengt
h            80-byte records.
 
               Various settings such as customized Program Function Key assignme
nts,           scroll amounts, display settings, editor settings, and recent TSO
               commands can be saved into the various members of the profile dat
a              se  t.
 
                 Changes are saved by default (when the profile data set is allo
cated)           but usually pro  file changes can be discarded if functions are
                   terminated with the 'CANCEL' command instead of the usual 'EN
D'                 command.

 )F Function -
   The REVIEW command allows a data set or UNIX entity to be examined at
     a 3270 TSO terminal in full screen mode.  Both disk and tape files
     may be REVIEWed.  If a PDS without a member is specified then a
     member selection list is displayed.  Load module members with a
     residence mo  de of ANY are shown in high intensity or green in the
       member list.  SCLM-managed members are flagged with an equals ('=')
       sign in the member list.  When looking at file data, a 'K' may be
       shown in the "ruler" head  ing line to denote the first and last, or
         only, column(s) of record keys.  On color terminals the portion of
         the "ruler" line corresponding to record keys is shown in red.  If
         the record format indicates printer ca  rriage control characters then
           an 'A' or an 'M' as appropriate may be shown in column 1 of the
           "ruler" heading line.
 
             REVIEW can format records according to Assembler data structure
             source code supplied by the user.  REVIEW can also format system
             related data such as SMF records, EREP data, VTOC entries, tape
               labels and load module structure and identification data.  REVIEW

tialized,                        offloaded in PDSLOAD (IEBUPDTE-like) format, or
 searched for                    specific or picture-masked data.  Load modules
can be offloaded                 into a sequential   format, and can be delinked
 into object decks.                Sequential offload files can be processed to

                                                 The 'REVED' command is a way of
 invoking   REVIEW and setting the                 default action for non-VSAM d
ata sets to edit with REVEDIT instead              of browse with REVIEW.  Using
 REVED with a sequential data set                  name immediately starts a REV
EDIT session.  Using REVE+ D with a                  partitioned data set name a
lters the meaning of th  e 'S' selection               code to mean edit (with R
EVEDIT) rather than browse (with REVIEW).

 authorization, with logical records being                 extracted from contro

             )O Operands -
             )P 'dsname' or 'dsname(member)' - The data set to be examined.
                'filename' - The DDNAME allocated to   the data set to be examin
ed.               'pathname' - The path name of an UNIX directory.
 
                  If the first operand begins with a slash ('/') the  n it is de
emed to             specify an UNIX directory path, and no other operands are al
lowed.              A specific UNIX file may be specified to directly access the
 data               contained in the file.
 
                      If the first operand does not begin with a slash then it i
s assumed             to be a DSNAME unless it is followed by the keyword 'FILE'
.
                        Specifying the quoted dsname of 'FORMAT4.DSCB' and a VOL
UME                     requests that the VTOC of that volume be REVIEWed.
 
                          Specifying the quoted dsname of 'ACTIVE' requests that
 the                      user's virtual storage (and not a data set) is REVIEWe
d.
                            Specifying the file name of PARMLIB when there is no
 PARMLIB                    allocated on a OS/390 1.2 or later system requests t
hat the                     logical PARMLIB service be used to   REVIEW the syst
em PARMLIB                    concatenation.
 
                              If no operands are supplied then REVIEW reads th
e screen image                  and extracts the data set name from the part of
the screen                      containing the cursor.  This works in both fulls
creen and line                  modes, but not under Session Manager which updat
es the screen+                    before REVIEW receives control.  If a data set
 name is no  t found                then normal TSO prompting is commenced excep
t for a recursive                   REVIEW session where a message is displayed.

                                           ))FILE     - This keyword indicates t
hat the first operand is                                a FILENAME, not a DSNAME
.  This is useful for looking                           at a temporary data set
or at concatenated li  braries.                           A member name may be s

 is ignored if 'VOLUME' is not specified.                           If 'VOLUME'
is specified the default unit is 'SYSALLDA'.                        For data set
s accessed via the catalog, the+  unit is                             determined
 from the catalog entry.

 This specifies a relative address within the                             data s
et to be considered as the logical top-of-data.                           'TOP'
performs the same function as the 'NEWTOP'                                  subc
ommand before the initial display of data.  As with                         'NEW
TOP', 'rel-addr' is a 1 to 6 hexadecimal digit                              numb
er interpreted as a TTR for disk data sets, or as                             a
BLOCK IDENTIFIER for tape data sets.  When 0 is                               sp
ecified or defaulted to, no special action is taken.                          Th

    and allow data set allocation for this to be successful.
    The subsystem data set name specified may include a
    member name in parentheses if appropriate.

CK    - This indicates that if an unquoted data set name was
        specified then the name was fully qualified apart from
          the prefix (ie. no trailing qualifier has to be added).
          This saves a search of the catalog to look for trailing
          qualifiers which is otherwise performed unconditionally
          unless th  e 'VOLUME' operand was specified.  This operand
            is ignored if 'VOLUME' is specified.

                              1) For a VSAM   component -
                                   'DATA' indicates that control interval inform
ation                              and DB2 tablespace structure is not to be int
erpreted                           and that physical blocks   are to be shown as

                                  2) For a VSAM KSDS (Key-Sequenced Data S  et)
cluster -                              'DATA' indicates that records are to be p
resented in                            RBA (Relative Byte Address) or physical o
rder rather                            than in key-sequence order.
 
                                      3) For a partitioned data set -
                                         'DATA' indicates that the PDS directory
 is to be                                  REVIEWed as a sequential file, thereb
y precluding                               access to the contents of members.
 
                                          4) For other disk files with fixed len
gth records -                                'DATA' indicates that direct access
 logic which can                             speed up access to different parts
of the file will                             not be us  ed.  This logic is emplo

nless 'DATA' is                                specified.  It is also used when
RECFM=FB and the                               VTOC indicates more th  an 256 tr
acks of data unless                              'DATA' is specified.
                                                 (If this direct access logic is
 used and the file                               does not use standard blocking,

                                                    5) For a SUBSYSTEM data set
with a member included -                               'DATA' indicates that a s
equential file will be                                   allocated to the specif
ied member only and data from                            other members will not
be accessible.  Use the 'DATA'                           operand if the subsyste
m data set has members but the                             subsystem does not su
pport partitioned access.                                  (Normally, if 'DATA'
was not specified then data from                           the nominated member
would initially be displayed,                              but   data from other
 members could subsequently                                  be displayed by usi
ng the 'MEMBER' subcommand.)
                                                          6) For a ZIP file '  D
ATA' indicates that the ZIP directory                          will not be forma
tted, but that normal sequential read                          and display proce
ssing will take place.  Only DASD                              sequential data s
ets, PDS mem  bers and UNIX regular                              files are check
ed for ZIP format by REVIEW.
                                                              7) For recognizabl
e picture file types such a  s PCX                                 (Paintbrush),
 BMP (Bitmap) and GIF, 'DATA' specifies                            that picture
data is not to be interpreted, but that                            normal data d
isplay processing will take place.                                   Without the
 'DATA' operand REVIEW would attempt to                              recognize s
upported picture data types, and render                              such pictur
es on the screen.  (The 'FORMAT OFF'                                   subcomman
d can be used from within REVIEW to instruct                           REVIEW to
 discard the picture data and therefore no                             longer sh
ow the picture image.  A subsequent 'NEWTOP'                           s  ubcomm
and could be used to reactivate the image                                display
.)  The first data record must be at least 80                            bytes l
ong for REVIEW to recognize picture data.  The                           renderi
ng of p  ictures is never attempted when REVIEW                            is ru
nning as an ISPF application.
                                                                        The 'DAT
A' operand may be abbr  eviated to 'D'.
                                                             ))XISPMODE - This s
pecifies that REVIEW                                                      1) is
not to act as an ISPF application and+  is therefore                           t
o perform terminal I/O and subcomma  nd processing
 natively; and                                                                2)
 is not to determine terminal capabilities from ISPF
 variables but is to issue a Read Partition (Query  )
   itself if appropriate.
 
This operand will only affect processing in an ISPF
  environment.
 
  The second function listed above relates to detecting
    the graphics capabilities of the TSO terminal.  If you
    want REVIEW to render graphic images (pictures) in an
    ISPF environment then the XISPMODE operand is required
    so that REV  IEW will detect that the terminal can handle
      graphics.  Without this operand, REVIEW determines
      color, highlighting and graphics escape support from
      ISPF, does not perform t  erminal I/O for a Query, and
        can therefore present non-graphic file data more rapidly.
 
        The 'XISPMODE' operand may be abbrevi  ated to 'X'.
                                                                             ))P

FSH' or 'HEL') and press <ENTER>.
                                                                    REVIEW has t
hree (3) different directory displays.  They are:                      (1) "PDS"
 type - for a PDS, a data PDSE, and concatenated                             fil
es of any sort of PDS and/or PDSE.                                       (2) "PD
SE" type - for an unconcatenated program object PDSE.                    (3) "UN
IX" type - for UNIX directories and files in                                 hie
rarc  hical file structures.
                                                                        The list
 of available subcommands and valid entry selection codes               depends
on the type of acti  ve directory display.  The 'FSHELP'                  comman
d will cause the valid options for that display type to be                shown.
 
                                                                            When
 REVIEW is running as an ISPF application, the HELP subcommand              will
 be intercepted by ISPF.
                                                 +                            Th
e default value of PF1 is intended to provide a  ccess to this
TSO HELP member which is primarily intended to document subcomands
available while REVIEWing file contents (as opposed to directories).
 
These subcommands are available while REVIEWing directories:
 
  BROWSE  - Causes ISPF Browse to be invoked to process the specified
    /B        member or file.
 
    DELINK  - (For load modules only.  Not for program objects.)
    /DL         This subcommand instructs REVIEW to delink load modules
                and write object "decks" to a sequential data set.
 
                The subject   PDS must have RECFM=U and must not be a PDSE.
 
                  Only tagged members are delinked, unless there are no
                  tagged members in which   case ALL MEMBERS are delinked.
 
                    REVIEW will attach the DELINKI program from CBT file 90
                    to perform the delink function.  Fixe  d-length 80-byte
                      records are written.  Note that SCATTER and OVERLAY
                      programs will NOT be handled correctly.
 
                        If the resultant object data is relinked, the new load
                        modules may not be bit-for-bit copies of the original
                        load modules, even though they should be functionally
                          equivalent.  That is, reconstructed load modules may b
e                         reblocked and/or reordered.
 
                EDIT      - (Not for program objects.)
                  /E        Causes ISPF Edit to be invoked to process the specif
ied                         member or file.
 
                    OFFLOAD - (Not for program objects or UNIX files.)
                                  /OFF      This subcommand instructs REVIEW to
offload PDS members                         to a sequential file.  Offloading ca
n be performed for                          a partitioned data set or concatenat

               Note:  'SEQLOAD' p  erforms the same processing as 'OFFLOAD'
                        except that no IEBUPDTE-like control statements are
                        generated, './' is not translated on output, and the
                        minimum output LRECL of   80 required by 'OFFLOAD' for

SELECTION CODES --------------
                                        These selecti  on codes can be used to s
elect an entry for processing             from a directory entry display:
 
                                            /       - Selection code   for selec
ting an entry to be REVIEWed                            from a PDS or PDSE membe
r list or UNIX directory list                           as if the 'DATA' operand
 had been specified.  Normally,                         the DATA operand preclud
es   access to PDS and PDSE member                        contents, and the DATA
 operand cannot be specified on                           an UNIX REVIEW request
.  This selection code performs the                       same function as the '
S' selection code   except that the                         DATA operand is deem
ed to have been specified.  This                            will prevent REVIEW
from attempting to interpret data                           content such as pict
ures and ZIP file directories.  '  /'                         and 'S' are identi
cal when used to navigate the UNIX                            directory structur
e.
                                                      A       - Selection code f
or selecting a UNIX file to be REVIEWed.                        This code instru
cts REVIEW to treat the file as an ASCII                        text file.  ASCI
I-to-EBCDIC translation is activated,                             and a new line
 is triggered by an ASCII LF character                            (x'0A') or an
ASCII CRLF string (x'0D0A').  (EBCDIC text                        files employ t
he EBCDIC NL character (x'15') to trigger                         a new line.)

r PDSE member   list, or UNIX directory list.                         In an ISPF

 program.
                                                                    M       - Se

p of a program.
                                                                      D       -
Selection code for deleting a member from an
unconcatenated PDS (not a PDSE) such that it can be
restor  ed by the 'R' selection code.
                                                                        R
- Selection code for restoring a deleted member and for
  resetting the tag s  tatus of an entry.  All tags can be
    cleared by REFRESH and RESET.  REFRESH will also clear
    display entries for deleted members meaning that they
    cannot be restored by the R sele  ction code.
                                                                            S
    - Selection code for selecting an entry to be REVIEWed
      from a PDS or PDSE member list, or UNIX direc  tory list.
        When a UNIX subdirectory entry is selected REVIEW treats
        this as a navigation request, and replaces the displayed
        entries with entries from the selected subdirectory.
 
          With the 'REVED' TSO command selecting a PDS member with
          'S' specifies that the member should be edited with
            REVEDIT.
 
            'S' is the default selection code, and is assumed
            when   the cursor is placed on an entry selection input
              field but no character is typed.
 
    T       - Selection code fo  r tagging an entry for later processing.
                Tagged entries are shown in high intensity or reverse
                video in the entry list.  For PDS and PDSE data sets,
                if any members are tagged, the  n only tagged members are
                  processed during offload (see OFFLOAD and SEQLOAD),
                  delink (see DELINK) and search (see SEARCH) operations.
                  For UNIX files, if any entries are tagged t+ hen only
                    tagged files are processed during searc  h operations.
                      Further, tagging an entry may be useful for display
                      control purposes when the entry list is large as RFIND
                      can be used to locate the next tagged entry.  All ta  gs
                        can be cleared by REFRESH and RESET.
 
              V       - Selection code for selecting an entry to be viewed
                          from a PDS or PDSE member list.  In an ISPF environmen
t                         ISPF/PDF View is used, otherwise REVEDIT is used.

.                =FORMAT=FMT
                 )F   The FORMAT subcommand causes REVIEW to format file data on
 the               screen according   to the data structure and types specified
in                   Assembler DS and/or DC statements.  The "ruler" heading lin
e above              the data is used to show the names of the visible data item
s, and               where room permits the startin  g column number of the item
 is shown              directly above the data item name.
                          The format of the actual file data remains unchanged w
hen HEX ON             is active.  When HEX OFF is current, each d  ata item is
formatted                according to the data type in the DS or DC statement.
The main data            types are character, hexadecimal, decimal, and binary i
nteger.                     The Assembler statements are read from the partition
e  d data set(s)           allocated to the REVFMTS file.  REVFMTS must be alloc
ated before it             can be used by this subcommand.  The TSO subcommand m
ay be useful in            helping to perform this allocation from within REVIEW
.  The FMTVAR                subcommand can be used to override the data type of
 a specific data             item or variable in a dynamic fashion.

               =COPYOUT=CUTOFF=CUT=CUTOVER
               )F   The COPYOUT subcommand   causes REVIEW to write records from
 the               data being REVIEWed to an output data set.  Records are writt
en                 consecutively from the first record shown on the screen until
                   the requested number of records has be  en copied or end-of-f
ile is               reached.  When complete, the first record AFTER the copied
records              is made the new top-of-screen record.  The COPYOUT subcomma
nd                   performs the same processing as the APPEND subcomma  nd exc
ept that               the output file is opened for OUTPUT, so that data alread
y residing             in the output file is overwritten and lost.
                          A major advantage that the COPYOUT and APPEND subcomma
nds pro  vide            is the ability to copy data that has been rendered inac
cessible by              I/O errors.  Data beyond an I/O error can be REVIEWed w
ith the use              of the NEWTOP subcommand.  Any data that can be REVIEWe
d can be                   copied and saved to an intermediate file for data rec
lamation.                     Another feature of COPYOUT and APPEND is selectivi
ty. Not only               can records be selected by manually scrolling to a sp
ecific record              and cuttin  g a specific number of records, but selec
tivity can be                automated with FIND ALL and FINDNOT ALL.  Only reco
rds eligible                 for display can be copied, so FIND ALL and FINDNOT
ALL subcommands              can be used to exclude   records based on their dat
a content not                  only from display but also from offloading by COP
YOUT and APPEND.                  Further, data copied from an ASCII file can be
 converted to EBCDIC           by specifying ASCII ON before commen  cing the CO
PYOUT operation.                    The user will be prompted with a data entry
panel to specify the             output data set.

ormally, the data type (binary, ASCII text or EBCDIC text) is                  d
erived from the zip archive directory entry for the file chosen
 for unzipping.
    For binary files fixed-length records are used, and the default
 record length is the number of columns of the TSO terminal screen,
 unless   the total byte count is a multiple of 80, in which case 80
   is used.
      For text records, variable-length records are used and the
   default maximum reco  rd length is 4092.  ASCII text records are
     terminated by ASCII LF or ASCII CRLF, and EBCDIC text records are
                   terminated by EBCDIC NL.  These control codes are discarded a
fter               triggering a new record, and are not actually output as data
bytes.                Some versions of the MINIZIP program can store MVS data se
