MXIBAT is a PDS interface to the Rob Scott MXI program via
the TSO/E Service Facility Routine, IKJEFTSR.
 
For example:
  MXIBAT IPL
  MXIBAT MENU
 
Add MXI to the AUTHTSF section of IKJTSO00 to run authorized
MXI commands with the PDS interface.  Caution, as this will make the
MXI ISPF Dialog run authorized as well.
