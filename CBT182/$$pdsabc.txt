This member documents changes to support the PDSMAN product:
 
 
PDS logic was changed to test for PDSMAN directory entries for the
following commands:
    ATTRIB listing APF level or SSI information
    ATTRIB with AUTH/NOAUTH change
    ATTRIB with SSI(hexdata)/NOSSI
    IF testing for AUTH/NOAUTH
    IF testing for APFERR/NOAPFERR
    IF testing for SSI/NOSSI/SSI(hexdata)
    MAP with JCL operand to determine APF and SSI
    RESTORE with LIKE operand to determine APF and SSI
 
 
Specific PDS support was added for PDSMAN directory entries for the
following commands:
    ATTRIB information listing for PDSMAN members
    DIRENTRY information listing for PDSMAN members
 
 
Please test the following PDS functions in a small PDSMAN controlled
test load library:
    ATTRIB for alias and nonalias members (note PDSMAN messages)
    DIRENTRY for alias and nonalias members (note PDSMAN messages)
    MEMLIST for alias and nonalias members (note APF byte)
    OPTION 5 on a MEMLIST panel
    ATTRIB with AUTH/NOAUTH keyword for alias and nonalias members
    IF testing with AUTH/NOAUTH keyword for the above
    ATTRIB with SSI(hexdata)/NOSSI for alias and nonalias members
    IF testing with SSI/NOSSI/SSI(hexdata) keyword for the above
    ALIAS XYZ ABC (where XYZ is a main member)
    RENAME XYZ ZZZ
    RENAME ABC CCC
    MAP with JCL keyword for alias and nonalias members
    VERIFY :
 
 
FIXPDS note:
    In order for FIXPDS EXPANDDIR or FREEDIR to work correctly in a
    PDSMAN environment, you must delete the space management member
    ($$$SPACE) before expanding the directory.  PDSMAN will restablish
    the $$$SPACE member the next time you compress the PDS.
 
    To expand the directory perform the following PDS subcommands:
    1. DELETE $$$SPACE     (remove the PDSMAN control member)
    2. FIXPDS EXPANDDIR... (expand the directory as desired)
    3. COMPRESS            (compress to resume PDSMAN monitoring)
